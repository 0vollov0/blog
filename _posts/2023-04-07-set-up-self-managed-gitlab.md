### Enviroment
- Ubuntu 22.04
- AWS EC 2 t.large instance

### Install
Follow the instruction on the link

link: [Download and install GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/install/#ubuntu)


### Apply up domain and HTTPS
When you installed gitlab, the gitlab server run as port 80 you can use nginx or something else.
You can set up nginx refer to this link [NGINX settings | GitLab ](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/nginx.html).
But I used aws S5 and cloud flont service to apply domain and HTTPS.

### Modify exteranl Url
```bash
ubuntu@user:~$ sudo vim /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb
```
Search `external_url` in the above file and change it to your applied domain url like below.
![/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb](/blog/assets/images/2a7fab6b-5ead-4adc-805d-a1f122bef5d3.png "/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb")

After modify, you need to run this line.

```bash
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

### Change Admin Password
After gitlab server has been installed and ran, you can check root(administer account) accountâ€™s password in the /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password.
Login as admin using id(root) and password that you checked in above.

1. Go to Edit profile where is in the right top drop down button.

2. Go to Password tab where is on the left side bar.

3. Chage admin password

### Set up SMTP as Gmail
